Tensors on free modules of finite rank
======================================

This is the reference manual for tensors on free modules of finite rank.

This work is part of the `SageManifolds <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/>`_ project 
but it does not depend upon other SageManifolds classes. In other words, it 
constitutes a self-consistent subset that can be used independently of 
SageManifolds.
