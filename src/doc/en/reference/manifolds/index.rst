Differentiable manifolds and tensor fields 
==========================================

This is the Sage implementation of differentiable manifolds and tensor fields
resulting from the `SageManifolds project <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/>`_.
This section describes only the "manifold" part of SageManifolds;
the pure algebraic part is described in the section
:ref:`tensors-on-free-modules`.

More documentation (in particular example worksheets) can be found 
`here <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html>`_.
