Tensors on free modules of finite rank
======================================

This work is part of the
`SageManifolds project <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/>`_ but it does
not depend upon other SageManifolds classes. In other words, it constitutes
a self-consistent subset that can be used independently of SageManifolds.
